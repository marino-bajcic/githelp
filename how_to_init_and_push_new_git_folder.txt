Adding a folder to GitHub using Git Bash involves a series of steps:

Initialize Git in your folder: If you haven't already initialized Git in your local folder, you need to do so. Open Git Bash, navigate to your folder using the cd command, and then run:

bash
git init
Add your files: Add the files you want to include in the folder using the following command:

bash
git add .
This command adds all the files in the current directory to the staging area.

Commit your changes: Commit the changes to your local repository with a meaningful message:

bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Create a new repository on GitHub: Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Make sure not to initialize it with a README, since you already have files to upload.

Add the remote repository URL: Copy the URL of your GitHub repository. Then, in Git Bash, add the remote repository URL using the following command:

bash
git remote add origin <repository_URL>
Replace <repository_URL> with the URL you copied from GitHub.

Push your changes to GitHub: Finally, push your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub:

bash
git push -u origin master
This command pushes the changes in your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.

After following these steps, your folder and its contents should be added to GitHub successfully. Remember to replace placeholders like <repository_URL> with the actual values.
